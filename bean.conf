# KloudBean deployment configuration
# Used when deploying this Django app to KloudBean.
# See: https://support.kloudbean.com/docs/application-deployment/
# Ensure Python 3.10 on KloudBean panel matches runtime.txt (python-3.10).

# WSGI entry point: Python module path and callable name.
# "config" = Django project package (config/wsgi.py), "application" = variable in that file.
# This is NOT the name of the app directory; it is the WSGI module. Do not use "platform" or "core" here.
APP_NAME=config.wsgi:application

# Application root directory. / = root of deployed app (the folder that contains manage.py, config/, core/).
# On KloudBean this is typically django-src; / means "that folder". The Django app code lives in core/ (not "platform").
APP_DIR=/

# Gunicorn workers (adjust per plan; 4 is a reasonable default)
WORKERS=4
